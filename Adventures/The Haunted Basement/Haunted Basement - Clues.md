PCs can find orders on parchment on the bodies of the goblins/men sent by the green hand, telling them that "we need magic to hone the edge of our blade. the gift can be shaped by our Hands". That's the easy note. 

Maybe there's a leader with more explicit instructions: "We need figure out how to guide it, look for barrier and resistance magic. payout is soon, your cut is coming."

could they find a jar of ooze on the body? if they get above a 20, yeah.

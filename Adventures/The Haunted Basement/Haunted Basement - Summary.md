Investigate haunted basement; maybe there's valuable goods that the owner is too afraid to get. Are there real ghosts or something else?





dead mobsters in the basement, they took over the cellar and disturbed some stuff.

Mobsters has evidence on them that they were looking for magical artifacts to help shape [[The Sludge]] seed, because it is causing weird damage.


#quest 

the shopkeep inherited this store from an estate sale for cheap, no questions asked. stored things in the cellar/basement and didn't really want to deal with the standing water. but then the green hand burst down there looking for stuff to steal (different from normal protection racket, mind you). 


I think they were directed by the green hand / gashak / someone to just gather magic STUFF. The green hand doesn't really understand magic, but they need something to like protect their own stuff in the tunnels from the sludge seed, which is starting to grow kind of out of hand.

Before our heroes arrive in Otter Valley, their journey down the river was interrupted by a number of challenges, forcing them to work together and/or interact in order to continue:

## Goblin Attack

Only half a day after boarding the river boat,  small party of river goblin bandits attempted to board and ransack the ship. The captain was knocked out cold; What did you do?

## Fantasy Ever Given

A chest containing an air elemental fell off a barge ahead of you, causing a whirlpool and wedging your boat into the side of the riverbank. How did you help free your craft to continue the journey?

## Cabin Fever
A fight broke out in the back of the barge, over the outcome of a dice game. Weapons were drawn, the air was tense. How did your characters deal with the conflict?

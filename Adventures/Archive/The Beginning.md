# The Beginning 

- Maybe, our heroes are traveling to [[Camor]] because the government is funding demonstrations of heroism, examples of Ellonian prowess.

- it is summer, in the month that we would call June. 
- it's late evening.
- Our heroes arrive on a crowded passenger boat bound for [[Camor]], but the boat stops at [[The Lock]] in [[Otter Valley]] due to the required 48 hour transition time.
- The wrangler of the boat (not the captain) orders everyone off and for them to go find a night at one of the couple inns in town.
- This happens a lot, so maybe there are snack stalls, barkers trying to convince people to stay at *their* particular inn, etc. 
- The heroes definitely don't have enough money for the FANCY or even NORMAL inn. They could steal it or make money otherwise.

#mystery : why is the innkeep so scared

### Things to happen in the first session MAYBE:

- rogue/thief goes up to Spoon and warns him about lack of thieves guild here. 
- starting in the tavern/inn, the heroes are served by a son of one of the owners (or something) who just started working. maybe 12-13 y/o
- Couple yakuza/green hand, having has a decent amount to drink, come to collect protection money from the innkeeper. The innkeeper doesn't have it this month or something. OR maybe the thugs demand some money from our heroes because of the table they're sitting at.  throws the kid on the table later
- #Encounter: [[lvl 1 green hand fight]]
- heroes kill the mobsters, and are celebrated by the travelers in the pub. BUT the innkeep is even MORE worried now.


- [[The Boss - Gashak]] confronts a innkeeper about refusing to pay his protection money to his underlings. Could easily defeat the heroes at first level. He enters with his lieutenants, [[Right Hand - Rufus]] and [[Left Hand - Caymarr]], who depending on the situation stay inside or stay outside.



-  Be told about at least ONE of the sidequests (or many)

Poisoned/bad bread from the old mill.  Rumors is that the green hand got a hold of it somehow, but beren is worried about the guy who runs it.

the mill is actually in the middle of the town, powered off of the waterfall. 

to get in and investigate, the party can talk to the person who delivers the bread, or sneak in via the rooftops, or whatever.

Front-person who sells the bread on the street is... [[Carter Copperhouse]]

The mill's driveshaft is being hindered by [[The Sludge]], and is making their bread, despite their best efforts, not very good. Have to fight some easy oozes and clear out the infestation, but it's not clear where it's coming from, maybe the sewers.
  
The millers are holding off the green hand just fine, but the father, [[Mestor Copperhouse]]has felt like this was the last straw.

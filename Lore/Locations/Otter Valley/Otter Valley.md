- Otter Valley is primarily a place where goods travel through on the [[Waywood River]]. 
- Otter Valley sprung up because of the small waterfall that is found at where the bridge in the town is now. The legend is that River Otters were seen jumping down this waterfall and seen as good luck.
- To help river boats and barges deal with the waterfall, a large [[The Lock|Lock]] was constructed to move boats down to the elevation of the river post-waterfall.
- A [[The Dam|dam]] was also constructed, with water wheels installed to facilitate the production of flour.
- When [[The Lock is Damaged]], it takes time to fix, and all trade stops.
- The [[Ellonian Government]] once stationed soldiers and captains in the town to protect the flow of goods, but the [[War]] has drained their numbers such that the town is undefended, save for some militia.
- There is a prominent layer of organized crime in town, with the major gang in town being called [[The Green Hand]]

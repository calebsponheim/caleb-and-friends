Carter Copperhouse - guy who sells bread and stuff out of [[The Mill]]. He doesn't really ask questions, doesn't want trouble, just a good salesman. 

He's frustrated that the quality of the bread has gone down, and it's become harder to sell the bread. 

Has the key to the mill to go pick up deliveries.

Lerick Grey is a wizard living in the bustle

keeping a low profile since [[The Green Hand]] started acting up more

non-binary, buzzed hair

kind of a rough and tumble wizard, very disorganized and defensive.

messy apartment, stuff all over the place

baggy eyes that they put there on purpose with make-up

hyper-active

has a contentious relationship with the doodad trinket shop owner

They were ordered from the capital city (their master) to go take care of otter valley as a challenge during the cold war, so they can earn their stripes. But they got here and were too scared to actually do anything. They are quite capable, and Beren has learned to take advantage of that (potions/scrolls/such), but they've had limited positive effect on the town because of their reclusiveness. Maybe there's some motivator that could bring them out of hiding. Giving them information about the Sludge would certainly help them spring into action.

Innkeep. 

Beren is world-weary, and has lived in Otter Valley for a long time. She has given up on fighting the Green Hand, because she initially saw them as better than the Ellonian government crackdown during wartime. 

Lost her husband to the war, took over the inn from him and has been doing great ever since. Her son, [[Irving Starriver]] is finally old enough to start learning the business and starting to wait tables. 

Southern accent for some reason.

Playing a rogue.
He's a far traveler, living on the shady side of life
A gruff figure, emaciated harengon. Very sallow. Does not say much. 
looks like he's seen some shit.

looks between late 20s and 40s. looks unfriendly and downtrodden.

he's a harengon.

wizard's experiment gone wrong. 

running away from things, not feeling like he belongs, not trusting anyone. no point in communicating with or sharing with people because it's dangerous.

his plan is to stay in Otter Valley for a while, get some more supplies and get back on the road. 

he doesn't want to go to [[Camor]]. He doesn't know what he wants. 

he had desires at one point to 

he developed a taste for meat and got kicked out of his harengon clan. 

**background**
he came from a harengon highly vegan society in the faewild; carefree rabbit folk, hobbit-esque.
one day an [[archfae]] wandered into their woods, and wanted to teach people the way of the bow. He took the fae up on the bargain. he learned how to use a bow, but gave him an insatiable urge to become the best bow user. He had this relentless desire to improve, and so he started hunting and developed a taste for rabbit and meat. his society was horrified by this.

after leaving the faewild, the guise to be the best was brokem, so he's been wandering since surviving. been on the road for many years. wandered into the underdark at one point, got imprisoned by a [[dragon]], and a mildflayer colony.

Taken a toll on his body and his mind. Left him a bit broken. Wandering for a long time now. Kind of a lost character.

He's level one because he's been broken down by the world, was a "higher level" once. He does enjoy archery still, and feels conflicted by that, but is searching for a new purpose and a place to belong

what he's doing to survive is enabling his own inability to thrive

he's been able to trust one or two people, but it's gone bad. 

he developed a friendship with a draugr, they got out of the dragon's managerie together. the guy led him to the mindflayer colony. 

Someone helped him escape from the mindflayer colony as well. the person who helped him was an eccentric human woman named [[Alice]] (hahaha). She helped him get out but then left him with a bunch of promises; her absentmindedness led her to abandon him after they got out 

### What's Cool About This PC:

### What are their motivations:
he is as fugitive in heart and in practice.

Spoon doesn't seek people out, but he's not anti-social. He's distrustful, but he's cunning. 
Kinda gruff, but has his own sense of honor and stuff. 
It doesn't feel good to him to be touchy feely, but he grew up with a lot of other hares.

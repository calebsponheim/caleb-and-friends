# Session Six (4-16-22)

## This time, it's in person.

### Session Planning

The major things going on:  
The Mill
The Lock and Dam  
The Farm


They may visit [[Lerick Grey the Wizard]]
They may talk to Beren again

They're still having a bugger of a time fixing the lock and dam. Mestor Gentleharp of the [[Halfling Family (The Gentleharps)]] is leading the fix, he's an engineer. If they go find him, he'll be thankful for their help at the tavern fight, and he will offer a sample of [[The Sludge]].

If they ask Lerick about what the notes mean, they don't know what the notes really mean, but the last reference to barrier magic they can remember is the baker asking for a resistance potion. They sold it to him and didn't ask questions. He didn't have a lot of money on him so he could only afford a potion, not a ring or anything like that.

They could try and find the entrance to the sewers. I'm not sure who they would ask about that, maybe Mestor. He could tell them.

it is the *third* day in Otter Valley.

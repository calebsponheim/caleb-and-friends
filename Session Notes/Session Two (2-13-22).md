# Session Two


## Session Prep

Describe the situation again. Rufus, big bugbear. Caymarr, wiley pirate. Green Hand crests on their chests.

[[The Boss - Gashak|Gashak]] doesn't have time for the heroes' shit (if they indeed try shit), and leaves [[Right Hand - Rufus]] and [[Left Hand - Caymarr]] to deal with them. 

Rufus and Caymarr should be able to deal with them handily, if that's the case. Either way, they wake up under the care of [[Beren Starriver]] up in the upper levels of [[The Wretched Beard]]. 

Beren explains what's happening with the Green Hand. maybe brings them downstairs to the bar in the morning

Someone comes rushing into the bar telling about the lock+dam breaking. [[The Lock is Damaged]]

Beren lays out the potential quests to weaken Gashak's hold on the town:

- [[Haunted Basement - Summary]] - contactperson is the resident wizard in the town, holed up in his apartment in The Bustle. Their name is [[Lerick Grey the Wizard]]
- [[The Mill]] - Beren has had to throw out bread from the local mill recently. Could talk to the bread delivery person (or the person who works the stall out front of the mill) to find a way into the mill.
- [[The Farm]] - Beren hasn't been getting veggies or meat from one of the collections of farms outside of town, and everyone has said that it's essentially gone dark out there.

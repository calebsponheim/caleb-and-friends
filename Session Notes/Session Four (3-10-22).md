# Session Four


## Session Prep

Finish the basement
[[Haunted Basement - Loot]] Loot the bodies (remember hand axes for Gotrek)

Look for clues [[Haunted Basement - Clues]]

they can go talk to [[Irma Lorenzo]] and get more loot if they want

Could unblock the sewer gate and get more loot from Irma. without unblocking it, they'll have to buy loot or convince her, I guess.


## Session Notes
- they found the two notes, NOT the sludge bottle
- they found an infinite decanter
- they drained the basement
- they'll get some free magic items in the next session, irma said so.

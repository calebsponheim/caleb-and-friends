# Session FIve

### Session Prep

Shopping Time!

Irma will let them have **two items** of their choice. They can buy others as well. The shop is open to them after hours as a gift.

They're welcome to go back to the [[The Wretched Beard]], or [[Lerick Grey the Wizard]]'s place

They'll probably sleep after that since it'll be late, unless they want to do something else

The major things going on:  
The Mill  
The Lock and Dam  
The Farm
